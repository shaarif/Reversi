Reversi
=======

Program to play the Reversi game using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms with two different evaluation functions: 1) number of pieces 2) positional weights. The rules of the Reversi game can be found e.g. in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi [1]. The interactive examples can be found e.g. http://www.samsoft.org.uk/reversi/[2]. In the Othello version of this game, the game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing light-up, two pieces with the dark side up, with same-colored disks on a diagonal with each other. However, the starting position will be specified in the input file. Program to implement the following algorithms for both min and max players. 2.1 Minimax using number of pieces as an evaluation function ; 2.2 Alpha-Beta pruning using number of pieces as an evaluation function ; 2.3 Alpha-Beta pruning using positional weights as an evaluation function.
